  <summary>In the life sciences industry, drug prices are determined based on a range of factors. These prices must also comply with regulations and laws specific to each country. In the pharmaceutical industry, drug pricing is a complex process influenced by numerous factors, including market demand, regulatory compliance, and financial adjustments such as discounts and rebates. Given the dynamic nature of drug pricing, pharmaceutical manufacturers need to constantly update their pricing models based on real-time data. However, the current manual approach using Excel sheets and other tools is labor-intensive, error-prone, and inefficient. 
  
  To address this challenge, we propose the “Formula Builder Tool”, an advanced software solution that automates drug price calculations using pre-configured formulas and real-time data.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The tool will allow manufacturers to efficiently determine price points by applying predefined business logic, eliminating the need for repetitive manual computations. It will feature a “real-time data repository”, “pre-configured formula storage”, “automatic execution engine”, and “comprehensive reporting capabilities” to support accurate price derivation.
